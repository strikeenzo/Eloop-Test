# Eloop Test

This challenge is about showing us that you are a hacker with a fast perception and excellent analytic skills
but also that you are able to dive into and leverage modern web technologies to create an awesome user experience.
We want you to build a progressive web application that shows a simple view on a list of products that any of our major sites offer.

**Step 1**

Take any of the 2 Social Media Channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Twitch, Snapchat, TikTok, Linkedin , ...

**Step 2**

Build a scraper in golang, rust, python, dart or any viable programming language u see that scrapes
the data Followers, Following, Likes, Post Count.
Choose two from each platform because on some platforms you will not find any postcount for example.

- Authenticate with a User over the WebApp
- Authenticate with a User via the reverse engineered App
- Get Data via Public Http Calls
- or 3rd Party Vendors

In the end please tell us why you choose which option.

**Step 3**

Create a Swagger UI API that starts the scrape to get the metadata.

Post data should take the username of the Social Media Platform

Here are some Account Handles you can test out.

**Bonus**

Cache Data in Postgress and make a React / VueJS frontend where you can search for users.

**Evaluation criterias**
What we look for:

- clean project setup and documentation
- ability to dive into a new topic, extract the important points and then code it up.
  polish and an eye for design: focus on making it look good instead of adding features.
- make it snappy
- display the important information at the right place without overloading. (e.g. in a list view of real estate properties,
  what are the important pieces of information beside a picture?)
- strip away features, time is scarce!
- document your approach, your decisions and your general notes
  Bonus: - add innovative features into these "classic" views. - provide a critique of the API you reverse engineered. - add additional features/gimmicks/easter egg. - extra bonus points for making us laugh - decentralise it or web3 it
